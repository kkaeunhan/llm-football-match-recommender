        "content": "The 2024/25 Premier League season has come to an end here at Anfield, and the final game for these two clubs ended in a draw. Palace will feel disappointed that they couldn’t score more than one on the day, but they rode their luck at times in the second half and could have easily conceded more. The game started quickly when Sarr opened the scoring only nine minutes into the game. He was found in space by Mitchell and tucked a right-footed finish past Allison to send the away end into raptures. The good mood carried on well into the second half, with Palace having the potential to add more goals, but they were pinned back after significant pressure from Liverpool. In the 84th minute, after an extended amount of defending, Palace’s lead vanished. Gakpo headed the ball down to Salah, who was unmarked, and smashed a scissor-kick style volley into the roof of Henderson’s net. That made the score 1-1, and that’s how the game ended. It was emotional inside Anfield as they said goodbye to Alexander-Arnold, but they ended their time together with a Premier League trophy. Liverpool ended the season with 2.17 xG after a lot of shots in the second half, and Palace ended with 1.73 xG, largely from the first half. Thank you for joining this live text commentary. Goodbye!"

Kieran Tierney opened the scoring in the 43rd minute on what was likely his final appearance for the Gunners, capping off his Arsenal career with a well-taken goal. Southampton responded with greater intensity after the break and deservedly equalised through Stewart, who powered home a spectacular header from a corner. It looked destined to finish level, but Arsenal skipper Martin Ødegaard - introduced in the second half - stepped up with a brilliant late winner to seal the points. It's been a below-par season by his standards, but a fine way to sign off. Arsenal ended the match with 2.20 expected goals compared to Southampton’s 0.63, underlining their attacking threat despite some wastefulness. Simon Rusk’s Saints were spirited and well-organised, and among those watching was Will Still, expected to take charge of Southampton in the Championship next season. A pivotal summer lies ahead for Arsenal, with a centre-forward surely high on the agenda. That’s all from us this afternoon - until next time, goodbye!"
