    "title": "Manchester United 0-3 Tottenham: Visitors pile more misery on Ten Hag with rout",
    "content": "Tottenham claimed a dominant win at Old Trafford to pile the pressure on Erik ten Hag, as they beat 10-man Manchester United 3-0 on Sunday.\nMicky van de Ven opened up United's defence with an excellent run to set up Brennan Johnson with just three minutes on the clock, and it never got better for United from then on.\nAlejandro Garnacho struck the post before Bruno Fernandes received a straight red card in the 42nd minute for a late tackle on James Maddison, giving United a mountain to climb.\nIt was a challenge they were unable to overcome, with Spurs capitalising on their numerical advantage early in the second half through Dejan Kulusevski before Dominic Solanke tapped home a third, and it could have been more, if not for some big Andre Onana saves.\nAnge Postecoglou's side rise to eighth with 10 points, while United slip to 12th, behind Brentford on goal difference.\nData Debrief: Spurs run riot\nIt has been a tough start to the season for United, who have only scored one Premier League goal at Old Trafford so far this season, with that coming in their opener against Fulham.\nFernandes' sending-off did not help matters, as he became the fourth United captain to be sent off in the competition at Old Trafford, receiving his first red card since joining the club (242 appearances).\nWhile the hosts may have been poor, it should not take anything away from Spurs. They accumulated a huge 4.67 expected goals from their 24 shots, with 10 of those on target.\nThey also had nine big chances, the joint-most ever created in a Premier League game after Arsenal v Fulham in January 2019. They scored two of the six they had in the second half as they cruised to their first away win in the competition this season."

    "title": "Chelsea 1-0 Leicester City: Cucurella strike moves hosts back into top four",
    "content": "Marc Cucurella's long-range strike was the difference as Chelsea beat Leicester City 1-0 to move back into the top four of the Premier League at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.\nThe Foxes did have their hosts sweating after Mads Hermansen saved Cole Palmer's first-half penalty, with the home faithful becoming agitated before Cucurella struck.\nEnzo Maresca's side looked set to take the lead after 20 minutes when Jadon Sancho was fouled by Victor Kristiansen but Palmer's spot-kick was superbly stopped.\nIt was the first time Palmer had ever missed from 12 yards in the Premier League and extended his goal drought to nine matches.\nLeicester came closest when Tosin Adarabioyo headed onto his own crossbar in the first half after Robert Sanchez had misjudged a cross, but only mustered three shots worth 0.1 expected goals (xG) otherwise.\nVictory over the side he left last year means Maresca takes Chelsea back up to fourth ahead of a trip to Arsenal next weekend.\nLeicester, meanwhile, stay 19th, six points off safety, and host Manchester United next time out."
